# Cracking the Code to Box Office Success

This project explores the factors influencing the financial success of movies. This GitHub repository contains the code and analysis for scraping movie data from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&num_votes=5000,&languages=en&sort=boxoffice_gross_us,desc&explore=genres&view=advanced), preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a machine learning model to predict movie gross revenue.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to uncover insights into the key factors contributing to a movie's success at the box office. I achieved this by scraping movie data from IMDb, performing extensive data preprocessing, and conducting exploratory data analysis. This analysis revealed valuable information about the relationships between various attributes of movies and their financial performance. Finally, I built a machine learning model to predict movie gross revenue based on these insights.

## Number of Movies Released Over the Years

This analysis of the trend in movie releases over time reveals interesting insights into the historical pattern of movie production. Key observations include:

- There has been a generally upward trend in the number of movies released over the years, indicating the growth of the film industry.
- An anomaly is observed in the years 2020-2021, with a sharp decline in the number of movies released due to the global COVID-19 pandemic's impact on film production.

## Revenue Over the Years

This analysis of movie revenue trends displays the total revenue generated by movies in 3-year intervals. Key findings include:

- There is a consistent upward trend in movie revenue over the years, indicating the overall growth of the film industry.
- A significant dip in movie revenue during the 2020-2022 interval is attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted the film industry.

## Movie Box Office by Top Directors

Contrary to the expectation that directing a higher number of movies would result in the highest box office revenue, the analysis revealed that prolific directors didn't always have the most financially successful films. The number of films directed did not necessarily translate into top box office earnings. Factors such as the quality, appeal, and impact of individual movies played a more crucial role in determining a director's success at the box office.

## Movie Box Office by Top Stars

In a similar vein, the analysis of top actors challenged the assumption that starring in a greater number of movies would directly lead to higher box office revenue. Instead, the findings showed that the quantity of films an actor appeared in did not guarantee top financial success. The star power, charisma, and appeal an actor brought to their roles were more influential factors in a movie's box office performance.

## Machine Learning Model
In this project a machine learning model to predict the gross revenue of movies based on the collected data was developed. The model-building process involved testing various machine learning algorithms to determine the best performer.

### Model Selection and Performance
After experimenting with several machine learning models, including random forest, boosting, regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, it was found that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were the most promising algorithms for revenue prediction task. These models demonstrated strong predictive capabilities and outperformed other algorithms.

### Model Fine-Tuning
To optimize the performance of the selected models, hyperparameter tuning was conducted, which involved fine-tuning the key parameters of the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models. This process allowed us to achieve a high level of accuracy of 92% in revenue predictions.

### Model Accuracy

After fine-tuning the hyperparameters, the machine learning model achieved an impressive accuracy of 92%. This means that our model can predict movie revenues with a high level of precision, providing valuable insights for the film industry.
