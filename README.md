# Cracking the Code to Box Office Success: Factor Analysis and ML Revenue Prediction Model

![Project Image](images/project_image.jpg) (Replace with an image relevant to your project)

## Project Overview

This project explores the factors contributing to the box office success of movies and develops a machine learning model to predict a movie's revenue. The analysis is based on data scraped from IMDb website, and the project is structured into the following components:

- **Data:** Contains the IMDb ratings dataset (`data/imdb_ratings.csv`) obtained from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&num_votes=5000,&languages=en&sort=boxoffice_gross_us,desc&explore=genres&view=advanced) and preprocessed to remove missing and duplicate values.

- **Notebooks:** Includes Jupyter notebooks for each major step in the project:
  - [`webscrapping-movie-dataset.ipynb`](notebooks/webscrapping-movie-dataset.ipynb): Web scraping IMDb data.
  - [`exploring-movie-success-factors.ipynb`](notebooks/exploring-movie-success-factors.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization.
  - [`movie-box-office-prediction.ipynb`](notebooks/movie-box-office-prediction.ipynb): Building and evaluating machine learning models for revenue prediction.

- **Models:** This directory will contain trained machine learning models for revenue prediction
