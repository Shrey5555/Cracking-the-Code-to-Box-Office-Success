Correlation Matrix Analysis\n\nIn data analysis, understanding the relationships between variables is crucial. A correlation matrix provides insights into how numerical features in the dataset are related to one another. In movie success factor analysis, the correlation matrix was calculated for the following numerical attributes: 'Year', 'Runtime (Minutes)', 'IMDB', 'Metascore', 'Votes', and 'Gross ($)'.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the correlation coefficients:\n\n- **Year vs. Other Attributes:**\n    - The 'Year' feature has a negative correlation with 'IMDB' (-0.196) and 'Metascore' (-0.193). This suggests that as the release year of a movie increases, its IMDb rating and Metascore tend to decrease slightly. \n    - 'Year' has a positive but weak correlation with 'Votes' (0.087) and 'Gross ($)' (0.107), implying that more recent movies tend to accumulate slightly higher votes and gross earnings.\n    - There is a very weak negative correlation (-0.062) between 'Year' and 'Runtime (Minutes)', indicating a minor decrease in movie runtime over the years.\n\n- **Runtime (Minutes) vs. Other Attributes:**\n    - 'Runtime (Minutes)' has a positive correlation with 'IMDB' (0.387), 'Metascore' (0.263), 'Votes' (0.314), and 'Gross ($)' (0.241). This suggests that longer movies tend to have higher IMDb and Metascore ratings, more votes, and potentially higher gross earnings.\n\n- **IMDB vs. Other Attributes:**\n    - 'IMDB' is positively correlated with 'Metascore' (0.736) and 'Votes' (0.409), indicating that movies with higher IMDb ratings tend to also have higher Metascores and accumulate more votes.\n\n- **Metascore vs. Other Attributes:**\n    - 'Metascore' has a positive correlation with 'Votes' (0.256), suggesting that movies with higher Metascores tend to receive more votes.\n\n- **Votes vs. Gross ($):**\n\n    - 'Votes' and 'Gross ($)' show a strong positive correlation (0.624), indicating that movies with more votes tend to have higher gross earnings.\n\nUnderstanding these correlations can help identify potential factors that contribute to a movie's success, such as runtime, ratings, and audience engagement.
